                <p>JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language.
                    It is a small and lightweight language. Inside a host environment
                    (for example, a web browser), JavaScript can be connected to the
                    objects of its environment to provide programmatic control over
                    them.

                <p>JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, such as Array,
                    Date, and Math, and a core set of language elements such as
                    operators, control structures, and statements. Core JavaScript can
                    be extended for a variety of purposes by supplementing it with
                    additional objects

                <p>JavaScript before ECMAScript 2015 does not have block statement
                    scope; rather, a variable declared within a block is local to the
                    function (or global scope) that the block resides within. For
                    example the following code will log 5, because the scope of x is the
                    function (or global context) within which x is declared, not the
                    block, which in this case is an if statement.
                </p> 
                <p>When you declare a variable outside of any function, it is called a
                    global variable, because it is available to any other code in the
                    current document. When you declare a variable within a function, it
                    is called a local variable, because it is available only within that
                    function.
                </p>                 
                <code>if (true) { let y = 5; } console.log(y);</code>                                             
                <li>Client-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying
                    objects to control a browser and its Document Object Model (DOM).
                    For example, client-side extensions allow an application to place
                    elements on an HTML form and respond to user events such as mouse
                    clicks, form input, and page navigation.

                <p>Global variables are in fact properties of the global object. In web
                    pages the global object is window, so you can set and access global
                    variables using the window.variable syntax.
                </p> 
                <p>Consequently, you can access global variables declared in one window
                    or frame from another window or frame by specifying the window or
                    frame name. For example, if a variable called phoneNumber is
                    declared in a document, you can refer to this variable from an
                    iframe as parent.phoneNumber.

                <p>The condition test occurs before statement in the loop is executed.
                    If the condition returns true, statement is executed and the
                    condition is tested again. If the condition returns false, execution
                    stops and control is passed to the statement following while.
                </p> 
                <p>You may also compound the statements using else if to have multiple
                    conditions tested in sequence, as follows:
                </p>                
                <code>if (condition_1) { statement_1; } else if (condition_2) {
                    statement_2; } else if (condition_n) { statement_n; } else {
                    statement_last; }
                </code>             
                <li>null. A special keyword denoting a null value. Because
                    JavaScript is case-sensitive, null is not the same as Null,
                    NULL, or any other variant.
